# Polynomial_regression

I have completed the "Machine Learning : A-Z" course delivered on udemy platform.

In this project, I have implemented the Polynomial regression model to predict the salaries as per the position level of the employee:

Pandas - for data preprocessing.
Numpy - for data preprocessing.
sklearn - to implement the Polynomial regression model.
matplotlib - to plot the results

Dataset:
Position_Salaries.csv: Data contains existing position levels and salaries of employees.
